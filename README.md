## Overview

This repository hosts a web application with a React and Vite frontend, and a Node.js (Express) backend. The frontend is deployed on Vercel, the backend REST API is hosted on Google Cloud Run, and the MySQL database is managed on Microsoft Azure. Image storage is handled via Cloudinary.

- **Frontend**: React and Vite with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for styling.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express, containerized with Docker and managed with Docker Compose.
- **Database**: MySQL on Microsoft Azure.

## Service Availability

If you encounter any issues accessing the application, it could be due to one of the following reasons:
- **Database Unavailability**: The MySQL database hosted on Microsoft Azure might be down or no longer available.
- **Backend Service Down**: The REST API service on Google Cloud Run may no longer be active.
- **Image Storage Issue**: Cloudinary might be experiencing issues, or image links could be broken.
